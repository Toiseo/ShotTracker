# Using Custom Targets

**If you wish to use a custom target, please follow these instructions:**

1. Print the Aruco markers and position them in the corners of your target. It is very  important that you place them in the right corner and with the right orientation. See the example setup image.
2. Due to the perspective correction the digital representation of the target can't be completely circular. Currently the app can't automatically create new targets, so you will have to draw a target over a reference image and replace the 'static/Target.png'. A automatic target creation feature will be added in the future.
3. Make sure that all markers are completely visible from the camera's perspective.
